## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In our project, we intend to create a site for finding several types 
of recipes and ingredients for them in nearby stores. The recipes will be 
of two categories: for vegetarians and for meat eaters.
In the project we will use two types of users: user and administrator.
Any user will be registered in the system with a specific role (user or 
administrator).
After registration and login, the user will be able to enter and select the 
category of the recipe that he interested in from the drop-down list, and 
then view the list of provided recipes. Also, a recipe search for a given text 
from the recipe name will be provided to the user.
Then the user can calculate the required amount of each ingredient for his 
recipe, according to the number of servings, and make a shopping list. 
The administrator can add, change or delete recipes and add or correct the 
list of ingredients.
### Features
